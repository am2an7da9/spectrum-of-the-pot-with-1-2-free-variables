# spectrum-of-the-pot-with-1-2-free-variables
This Maple program is designed  to  find  all  possible  orders  of  graphs  that  a  given  pot  will realize in Scenario 2 in the case where there are free variables in the solution set of the construction matrix.  More details about this program can be found in the paper, "Computational complexity and pragmatic solutions for flexible tile based DNA self-assembly" written by Leyda Almodovar, Jo Ellis-Monaghan, Amanda Harsy, Cory Johnson, and Jessica Sorrells
